1.
Download launcher:
https://github.com/remyroy/CDDA-Game-Launcher/releases

2.
You download the launcher, install latest experimental build because latest stable is lame and has less stuff.

3.
Download tileset below:
https://github.com/SomeDeadGuy/UndeadPeopleTileset

4.
You navigate to [THE PATH YOU INSTALLED TO]..\CDDA Game Launcher\cdda\gfx\[DRAG FOLDER CALLED "MSX++UnDeadPeopleEdition" HERE]

5.
Download soundpack:
You open the launcher, navigate on the top of the window where the menu is called "Soundpacks" you choose: Chesthole's soundpack cuz its coolest
Once you know what ur doing you'll change it however you like, but it sucks without playing sound

Another tip: running out of stamina in-game means your soundpack will make sure ur character's heart beats so loud you cant enjoy the game so you do this:
[THE PATH YOU INSTALLED TO]..\Desktop\CDDA Game Launcher\cdda\data\sound\ChestHole
Where you open soundset.json and find the lines that have "fatique" with them by using CTRL + F
And you change the volume for all of those to "volume" : 20,

6.
YOU FINALLY, boot up the game and navigate to settings ASAP.
Settings -> Options -> General -> At the bottom there is "Choose soundpack" which you set to "ChestHole" from "Basic"
Congratz, now you have sound and music.

7.
Settings -> Options -> Graphics -> Almost in the middle there is "Choose tileset" which you set to "UNDEAD_PEOPLE ( NEW VERSION )"

8.
Congratulations, you are ready to suffer learning the controls and after you finally know how to move around you can start experiencing true suffering.
